The image is distroless `nonroot`, `ENTRYPOINT ["/altempl"]`, `CMD ["serve"]`, exposing 5150 — so any
subcommand runs as `docker run --rm altempl:dev migrate status`. Releases are cosign-signed and carry
an `attest-build-provenance` attestation. `<owner>` comes from `GHCR_OWNER` on release and
`github.repository_owner` on `main`. Base images are digest-pinned in `Dockerfile` — refresh with
`docker manifest inspect <ref>` and update the two `ARG` lines.

## Local dev stack (compose)

`compose.yaml` starts Postgres 18 + [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) + NATS (JetStream,
token `altempl-dev`) + altempl, under `docker compose` or `podman-compose`. altempl is at
`http://127.0.0.1:5150/login`; every outbound email lands in Mailpit at `http://127.0.0.1:8025`.

```bash
make compose-up          # build + start everything
make compose-logs
make compose-down        # stop, keep volumes
make compose-nuke        # stop + wipe docker/data/pg
```

Postgres data lives at `./docker/data/pg` and NATS data at `./docker/data/nats` (bind-mounted,
`.gitignore`d). The stack runs `selfhosted` with `ALT_DB_ALLOW_BYPASS_RLS=true` (RLS off),
Mailpit's open SMTP and the queue on; production mail goes under `mail.smtp.*` (or `mail.resend.*`
with `mail.driver=resend`), and the role graph below.

The Postgres 18 image keeps its cluster under `/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker`, so
`./docker/data/pg` mounts at `/var/lib/postgresql`. A data directory created by the Postgres 17
stack does not start on 18: run `make compose-nuke` to start fresh, or `pg_upgrade` it (or
`pg_dumpall` from 17 and restore into 18) to keep the data.

## Postgres

**Dev**: point `ALT_DB_DSN` at any role (superuser is fine), set `ALT_DB_ALLOW_BYPASS_RLS=true`; RLS is off.

**Production**: `scripts/db/provision.sh` creates a six-role graph — `altempl_owner`
(`NOLOGIN CREATEROLE INHERIT BYPASSRLS`, owns every object), `altempl_migrator` and
`altempl_service` (LOGIN, neither holds `BYPASSRLS`), and `altempl_editor` / `_reader` / `_ops`
(NOLOGIN human groups). No role is both LOGIN and `BYPASSRLS`. The role table, the
`SECURITY DEFINER` wrappers for cross-tenant reads and why `GRANT altempl_owner TO x` does not confer
`BYPASSRLS`: [`multitenancy`](../multitenancy/README.md#postgres-roles). Day-2 operator procedures, provider
notes and the post-migration `verify.template.sql`: [`scripts/db/README.md`](../../scripts/db/README.md).

Provision idempotently (interactive; prompts for admin URL, DB name, passwords), then point the app
at the two LOGIN roles:

```bash
APP=altempl DB_NAME=altempl scripts/db/provision.sh

ALT_DB_DSN=postgres://altempl_service:<svc-pw>@host:5432/altempl?sslmode=require
ALT_DB_MIGRATOR_DSN=postgres://altempl_migrator:<mig-pw>@host:5432/altempl?sslmode=require
ALT_DB_MIGRATOR_ROLE=altempl_owner
ALT_DB_ALLOW_BYPASS_RLS=false
```

- `db.migrator.role` is the sole source of the migration role, issued once per connection rather
  than inside the migration SQL; `db.role` applies only to runtime connections.
- `005_definer_functions.sql` refuses to apply when the migration role lacks `BYPASSRLS`, and names
  the `ALTER ROLE` that fixes it.
- Boot fails if the runtime role has `BYPASSRLS` and `db.allowBypassRLS` is `false`
  (`schema.RLSGuard`, `ErrRLSBypass`), and audits every tenant table for RLS, FORCE and a scoped
  policy.
- `mode=cloud` with `db.autoMigrate` and RLS enforced requires `db.migrator.dsn` — boot rejects the
  combination otherwise.

## Reader replica

`db.Pool{W, R}` wraps writer + reader. SQLite always aliases `R` to `W`. For Postgres,
`ALT_DB_READER_DSN` routes non-tenant reads (`user`, `onboard`) to a replica; empty aliases to `W`.
Tenant-scoped reads run on `W` — `tenant.PgConn.BeginTenanted` needs `set_config` inside the
transaction, which a replica cannot serve. Unit-of-work primitives:
[`multitenancy`](../multitenancy/README.md#unit-of-work); module authors:
[`modules`](../modules/README.md#3-tenant-scoping).

## Health probes

`/healthz`, `/readyz` and `/robots.txt` are mounted at the outer mux root on the `Probes` chain —
NOT under `http.basePath`. Deliberately: orchestrator probes (compose, kubelet, LB target groups)
reach altempl on its listen port directly, so their config survives a remount; and public proxies
typically route only `example.com/<basePath>/*`, keeping `/healthz` off the public surface.

- `/healthz` — the process is serving. Never touches the DB.
- `/readyz` — every DB handle passed the most recent probe (200), else **503**. Reads the snapshot.

Boot probes once synchronously before the listener accepts traffic, so `/readyz` is accurate from
the first request — no unready window on rollout. `db-health` then refreshes the snapshot every
`db.health.interval`, so readiness lags a DB outage by up to one interval. It is a standalone `Worker`
on the HTTP listener's `Supervisor`, not a scheduler job, so it runs in **every** replica regardless
of `scheduler.enabled` or `serve --no-scheduler`. Each replica probes its own pool; the snapshot is
never shared. A probe failure is logged and the worker keeps ticking — it never reaches the
notification sinks and never fails the process.

**`altempl healthz`** is the compose and k8s healthcheck: a self-contained probe that needs no
`curl`, which the distroless image does not have.

- Default target is `http://127.0.0.1:<port from http.addr>/healthz`.
- `--url` (or `ALT_URL`) moves it; a saved CLI profile deliberately does not.
- `--timeout` defaults to `3s`. Exit is non-zero when the probe fails; `--output json` prints
  `{url, status, ok, took, error}`.
- Public status page? Route it explicitly in the proxy, e.g. nginx
  `location = /altempl/healthz { proxy_pass http://altempl:5150/healthz; }`.
- Pre-deploy smoke test: `bash scripts/verify-serve-smoke.sh` boots `serve` on ephemeral SQLite,
  curls `/healthz`, sends SIGTERM and asserts clean shutdown.

## Scheduler and queue

Scheduler singletons, pool sizing, NATS on Railway, the `serve` deployment shapes and what
multiple replicas need: [`workers`](workers.md).

## MCP

`/mcp` (S7) is off by default. The env block, the enforced enable order (`tokens.issuer` →
`http.baseURL` → `mcp.enabled`, each omission a boot error), the audience
rules — default `baseURL + basePath + /mcp`, widened only by `mcp.audienceOverride` — and
`bash scripts/verify-mcp-smoke.sh`: [`mcp`](../mcp/README.md#setup).

Deployment-side: the proxy must pass `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource<basePath>/mcp` and
`…/api` through — both are unauthenticated, a host discovers the endpoint through them and Othra
verifies each resource server by reading them. A proxy
terminating on a different public URL needs `ALT_MCP_AUDIENCE` plus `ALT_MCP_AUDIENCE_OVERRIDE=true`.

## Observability

| Concern | Keys                                                                                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Traces  | `telemetry.tracing.enabled` + `telemetry.otlp.endpoint` (`protocol`, `insecure`, `headers`) |
| Metrics | `telemetry.metrics.enabled`, `telemetry.metrics.exportInterval`                             |
| Scrape  | `telemetry.metrics.prometheus.enabled` / `.addr` (`:9091`) / `.path` (`/metrics`)           |
| Logs    | `log.level`, `log.format`, `log.addSource`, `log.redactPatterns`                            |
| Alerts  | `observability.reporter.minSeverity` (`error`), `observability.reporter.sinks`              |

- Prometheus listens on **its own** address, not the app listener — keep `:9091` off the public
  network rather than reverse-proxying it.
- HTTP, Connect, worker and DB spans all propagate via `context.Context`. Every request log carries
  `request_id` and `trace_id`.
- Unhandled errors fan out via `apperror.Reporter` to `internal/platform/notify` sinks: `stdout`,
  `slack`, `discord`, `googlechat`, `email`. Each entry in `observability.reporter.sinks` is
  `{kind, webhookUrl, to, from, subject}`.
- SECURITY: these sinks reach **operators**. A tenant's endpoint belongs on the dispatch surface,
  never here — see [`surfaces`](../surfaces/README.md) S5.

## API surface

Connect-RPC mounts under `basePath + /api` (`api.enabled`). `todo.v1.TodoService`,
`blog.v1.BlogService`, `apikey.v1.APIKeyService` and `auth.v1.AuthService` ship in the scaffold.
OpenAPI 3.1 is embedded at build time and served at `basePath + /api/openapi.{yaml,json}`, with a
rendered view at `basePath + /api/docs`. All three sit behind `api.openapi.requireBasicAuth` (default
`true`) using `api.openapi.basicAuthUser` / `basicAuthPassword`; `api.openapi.enabled: false` 404s
them.

## OIDC

Sign-in, CLI login and bearer tokens all come from one Othra project, whose issuer is
`https://<othra>/p/<handle>`. Register in this order, because Othra reads the app's RFC 9728
documents before it accepts a resource server:

1. Start the app with `http.baseURL`, `oidc.issuer` and `tokens.issuer` set to the project issuer
   (they must be equal). `tokens.audience` and `mcp.audience` derive from `http.baseURL`, and the
   two documents are now served at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource{basePath}/api` and
   `…/mcp`. `selfhosted` boots without client credentials; `cloud` refuses to boot without
   `oidc.clientID` and `oidc.clientSecret`, so set any non-empty placeholder for both until step 5.
2. In Othra, create two resource servers: `https://<host><basePath>/api` (the control plane) and
   `https://<host><basePath>/mcp`, each with the scopes its document lists. The documents never
   list a retired scope such as `apikeys:write`: key management stays in the console.
3. Create a web client (confidential) with redirect URI `https://<host><basePath>/oauth/callback`
   and post-logout URI `https://<host><basePath>/`, and a CLI client (native, public) with redirect
   URI `http://127.0.0.1/callback` (RFC 8252; any port matches) and refresh tokens on, so
   `auth login --url` gets `offline_access`. Mark both first-party.
4. Link the web client to both resource servers, and the CLI client to the control plane, with
   their scopes. The CLI needs `apikeys:read` for `Whoami`.
5. Set `oidc.clientID`, `oidc.clientSecret` and `oidc.cliClientID`, and restart.
6. Optional: to accept `othra_pt_` personal tokens, set `tokens.introspection.*` (and
   `mcp.introspection.*`) to each resource server's public id and introspection secret.
7. Open `/login`. On a fresh install the first sign-in goes to `/onboard`, which needs the one-time
   URL boot logs as `boot: setup required — open this one-time onboarding URL url=…/onboard?token=…`
   (or a pinned `onboard.setupToken`).

Signing out also ends the Othra session through RP-Initiated Logout, back to the post-logout URI;
set `oidc.endSessionOnLogout=false` to keep the Othra session.

While Othra or the database is unreachable, a bearer token that cannot be checked answers
`Unavailable` (Connect) or `503` (MCP) with code `TKN002` and no `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, so a
client keeps its token and retries.

### Cloud mode locally

`mode=cloud` runs on Postgres only; SQLite is refused at boot. A throwaway local setup:

```bash
podman run -d --name <app>-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev -p 5432:5432 postgres:18
export ALT_MODE=cloud ALT_DB_DRIVER=postgres ALT_DB_ALLOW_BYPASS_RLS=true \
  ALT_DB_DSN='postgres://postgres:dev@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable' \
  ALT_SECURITY_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  ALT_GENESIS_EMAIL=you@example.com \
  ALT_HTTP_ADDR=:5150 ALT_HTTP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5150 \
  ALT_MCP_ENABLED=true
```

`ALT_HTTP_ADDR` and `ALT_HTTP_BASE_URL` must name the same port. `ALT_MCP_ENABLED` is off by
default; without it the `/mcp` resource server in step 2 has no document to read.
`ALT_GENESIS_EMAIL` must be the email the first operator signs in with at Othra. Then follow the
registration order above (issuer, placeholders, register, real credentials); the first `/login`
lands on `/onboard`, which takes the one-time token from the boot log.

A user is matched by `(issuer, subject)`. A first sign-in from a new issuer relinks an existing
user only when the issuer marks the email verified and the row is unlinked or linked at another
issuer. An unverified email for an unknown subject is refused (`USR006`), and so is a verified
email whose user is linked to another subject at the same issuer (`USR007`).
